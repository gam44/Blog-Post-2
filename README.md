### Provisional Landscape

The above piece of art, created by Manuel Fernández, really struck me because it looks like an oil-on-canvas painting when in fact it is composed of digitally generated brushstrokes. This image is part of a video called Provisional Landscape, which consists of several scenic vistas set against the checkered Photoshop background. I think viewers are supposed to initially find comfort and beauty in the familiar vistas, but then find discomfort in the Photoshop background and the unnaturalness of the natural scenes. This image made me think about the ways in which we experience reality in the age of the Internet. Particularly, it brought to mind how we often view natural settings through technological lenses.

### Behind the Wall

These two screenshots are part of a video created by Claude Maté titled, “Behind the Wall.” I was drawn to this video because of how disturbing I found it – it features a young child who is trapped within his yard with a clown/Donald Trump that haunts him when he dries to escape. This theme in and of itself is provoking, but I also found it interesting that Maté chose a very current and relevant political topic and combined that with a dated and choppy video.  This juxtaposition confused me, as I image it confused other viewers as well.
